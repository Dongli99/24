## Overview

The 24 Game is a mathematical card game where the objective is to use
four given numbers and the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to
arrive at the number 24. Players must use all four numbers exactly once
and can only use each number once. The game can be played competitively
or as a solo puzzle.  

The project explores possible ways to solve the game.

> Example: given numbers 5, 12, 2, 10, the solution can be: (5+12)*2-10=24
